# Graduate Cosmology & Extragalactic Cheat Sheet

This repository contains a working **Cosmology & Extragalactic “Cheat Sheet”** prepared for the graduate course.  
It summarizes key formulas, scaling laws, cosmic timescales, and derivations (e.g. Press–Schechter from spherical collapse).

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
This is a **work in progress**. There will be typos, missing factors, and approximations. Please **use critically** and help improve it.

## ✅ How to Contribute
We’d like this to become a **living, collaborative document**.

1. **Fork this repository**  
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine  
3. Make changes in the LaTeX file(s)  
4. **Commit** with a clear message (e.g., “Fixed factor of 2 in virial overdensity”)  
5. **Push** to your fork  
6. Submit a **Pull Request**  

Alternatively, you can also just **open an Issue** if you spot a mistake but don’t want to edit the LaTeX directly.

## 💡 Guidelines
- Keep notation consistent (e.g., $a$, $z$, $H(z)$, $\Omega_m$).  
- Add references where useful (textbook, review, paper).  
- If you add sections, use the same structure (numbered, concise, minimal prose).  
- Try to keep equations in display mode for clarity.

## 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 Audience
This is meant for graduate students in cosmology and extragalactic astrophysics.  
Please **contribute with that audience in mind** — concise, reliable, pedagogical.

## 🔮 Future Ideas
- Add diagrams (e.g., cosmic timeline, spherical collapse schematic).  
- Include scaling relations for toy universes in a more visual table.  
- Add quick derivations for Jeans scale, sound horizon, etc.  
- Possible Python notebooks for CAMB/CLASS examples.
